Many of the names in the recog package are found 
to be unintuitive or inconsistent with other names.
For these reasons the names were changed to be more descriptive
and to follow the internal consistency of &GAP;.
In this chapter a dictionary from old to new names is included.
The meanings of certain old names are described in the paper
"Components of the recognition info record" of <Cite Key="NS06"/> in Section 2.6.
